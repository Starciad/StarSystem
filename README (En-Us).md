<p align="justify">StarSystem is a micro operating system simulator developed for study purposes. It has an internal memory management system, which can be configured through the configuration XML file. In addition, Star System offers users a complete and simplified system of CLI commands that can be accessed directly from the program's console. These commands are created and registered during program startup, and adding new commands is easy and intuitive, allowing the user to customize the system with a multitude of custom commands in a matter of minutes.</p>
